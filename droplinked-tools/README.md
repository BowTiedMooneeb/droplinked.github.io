# Droplinked Tools

Learn how to use droplinked tools and endpoints to unlock the power of web3 commerce for as a producer or publisher.

This site provides documentation for the tools necessary to interact with droplinked protocol.

This documentation is geared towards users, system administrators and technical resources wishing to understand and integrate with the protocol.

### Droplinked Developer Sandbox

There are two web3 libraries that provide base infrastructure required for droplinked's operation on any given chain:

* [**NFT Fractionalizer**](https://fractionalizer.droplinked.com/)****
* **DIMST registry by chain** (Decentralized Inventory Management and Sales Tracking)

To interact with the droplinked protocol, droplinked provides three key tools:

* **OAuth**
  * Use crypto wallet credentials to authenticate and interact with the droplinked protocol
* **DIMST Console**
  * CLI and UI for simple execution of product registration, inventory management, sales tracking, and batch operations
* **Headless embeddable units for inventory display**
  * Allows producers and publishers to quickly and easily embed droplinked integrated storefronts onto their pages and properties



### Traction & Timeline



These base components of the droplinked protocol have already been built and deployed on the Stacks network. Infrastructure buildout is currently underway for Casper, Solana, Hedera Hashgraph, and Ripple networks, with expected completion in Q1 2023. Polygon, ethereum, near, and flow are in the pipeline.

Deployment on each of these networks will allow for commerce settlement in the native token of each respective network and will serve as the foundation for cross-chain interoperability bridges.

Droplinked 1.0 testnet development will begin in 2023. Droplinked 1.0 will tie together the base infrastructure to allow for a holistic cross-chain protocol, complete with token contracts, droplinked treasury, and staking functionality.&#x20;
