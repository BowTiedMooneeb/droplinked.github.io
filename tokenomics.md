Tokens associated with Droplinked smart product contract listings and the strategic treasury vault are locked. The contract can only pay adopters and circulate an allocated percentage of holdings once a transaction is recorded, milestone met or total GMV transaction threshold is reached to reward the entire network of adopters and contributors.

Token distribution is locked into a 36 month duration from mainnet launch for the team and acquirers of the SAFE w/ token warrant issuance.

### Framework & Definitions

#### Droplinked SPC Pool

This allocation is reserved for the decentralized registration of products linked to smart contracts. When a manufacturer or producer lists an item through droplinkedâ€™s decentralized inventory management system, they define their payout amount along with the  % or commission fee paid to a publisher or promoter for generating the sale. By default, every conversion contributes 1% of every sale as a network fee back into the Droplinked Treasury Vault.

#### Droplinked SPC Transactions

By default all product listings re-circulate 1% of every sale generated back into the Droplinked Treasury Vault. Vault disbursements are pegged to deposited assets used for campaign and promotional activities with authenticated partners (brands, retailers, artists and projects) adopting the Droplinked network. This incorporates any dapp, marketplace or company looking to streamline community marketing efforts through a native token with customers and creators.

#### Droplinked Treasury Vault

Treasury accepts/retains USD/USDC/BTC/ETH/STX and more. Threshold milestones trigger yields for the total amount of gross merchandise value sold across the network that qualify towards treasury recontribution.
