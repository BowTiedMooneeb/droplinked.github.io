# tokenomics

DROPS token powers the networks decentralized governance and incentivizes long-term engagement for network contributors by providing an earned yield to all true contributors staking.

### emissions

Aside from the pre-allocated supply tokens used to incentivize investment and development, the only way for new DROPS tokens to be generated is through sales activity related to smart product contract (SPC) listings. These new tokens are allocated to contributors along the commerce supply chain, with pre-defined splits defined by the producer. Tokens are only distributed by the droplinked protocol once a sale is recorded and settled on-chain. As such, the aggregate amount of tokens paid to producers and publishers is variable, leading to a variable total supply based upon network activity.

Token distribution is released over a 36 month period with a 1 year release cliff from TGE launch for both the team and acquirers of the token warrant.

### network milestones

Yield payouts to DROPS stakers occur when the network hits GMV sales milestones and are detailed in the table below. As DROPS tokens are issued in proportion to total network sales, we can estimate outstanding DROPS tokens at each milestone, along with the estimated annualized yield for stakers. In the table below, \~55M DROPS tokens are assumed to be unlocked to investors, team, etc. between Phase 2 and Phase 4.

### framework & definitions

#### droplinked SPC pool

This allocation is reserved for the decentralized registration of products linked to smart contracts. When a manufacturer or producer lists an item through droplinkedâ€™s decentralized inventory management system, they define their payout amounts along with the % or commission fee paid to a publisher or promoter for generating the sale. By default, every conversion contributes 1% of each sale as a network fee back into the droplinked treasury vault.

#### droplinked treasury vault

Treasury accepts and retains USD/USDC/BTC/ETH/STX/SOL and more. The tokenized yield stored into the droplinked treasury will be converted to USDC to maintain value>minimize value volatility. Threshold milestones trigger yield payouts based on phases for the total amount of gross merchandise value sold across the network.
