# What is droplinked?

### problem

Centralized platforms and third party intermediaries have taken excess profits across the commerce supply chain by nature of their centralized infrastructure. Droplinked offers a transparent solution through the decentralized registration of products linked to smart contracts.&#x20;

### droplinked

Droplinked is a commerce infrastructure network operating as a decentralized inventory management and sales tracking system for digital and physical goods.&#x20;

By decentralizing inventory management, droplinked allows authenticated producers to easily tie digital or physical products to NFTs, and distribute these quickly and transparently to publishers that help to market and sell their listings. Through multiple blockchain integrations, companies can automatically and trustlessly coordinate with publishers to sell items and settle value. Partnership terms are immutably outlined through their chain of choice to maximize economic efficiency in a secure and transparent manner.\
\
Droplinked utilizes a token, DROPS, that streamlines compensation, swapped into whatever form of settlement preferred by an authenticated producer (manufacturer or company) or publisher (website, app or marketplace). The token can be staked by contributors to earn a yield that scales with network growth.

### how it works

Droplinked combines four critical functions into a single protocol to simplify web3 commerce for producers and publishers while incentivizing contributors with earned ownership in the network. By combining these features, droplinked streamlines inventory management and sales tracking for producers and disintermediates legacy affiliate networks.

### decentralized registration of products

Producers register their goods across the blockchain of choice. Each item listed and sale generated is instantly verifiable on-chain with variables associated with the listing (color, size, description, quantity, price, commission, etc.). Once a product's attributes have been defined, an NFT is minted which is then fractionalized through [droplinked's NFT fractionalizer](https://fractionalizer.droplinked.com) with each NFT representing one unit of the product.

### authenticated distribution

Producers can identify and authorize publishers which may sell and distribute their products, giving brands the power to select their partners and pre-define contract terms for affiliate sales. As these terms are defined through smart contracts on the Droplinked network, brands can simplify their distribution process and rest assured with maximum transparency and settlement guarantees.&#x20;

Through these publishers, brands can quickly and strategically deploy their products to multiple properties through headless infrastructure integrations while leveraging unique benefits such as token-gating, loyalty programs, and custom campaigns and offers.

### trustless settlement

There are numerous participants across the commerce supply chain. Droplinked simplifies payment to contributors by recording all sales settlement on-chain, with immutable splits defined to producers, owners, distributors, affiliates and partners.

With every sale, the droplinked network takes a 1% protocol fee which is automatically deposited into the droplinked treasury.

### network yield

1% of the value of all sales is automatically taken as a fee and reserved in the droplinked treasury. Additionally, Producers and Publishers can choose to receive a portion of their settlement value in DROPS tokens. For whatever portion they choose to receive in DROPS, a proportionate amount of the fiat value of their settlement is also reserved in the droplinked treasury.

The treasury grows through the protocol fee as gross network sales increase. Contributors are entitled to the network yield through staked DROPS. This provides a mechanism for rewarding early adopters, who can quickly generate a stake in the future growth of the network.
