# droplinked toolbox

Learn how to use droplinked tools and endpoints to unlock the power of web3 commerce for as a producer or publisher.

This site provides documentation for the tools necessary to interact with droplinked protocol.

This documentation is geared towards users, system administrators and technical resources wishing to understand and integrate with the protocol.

### droplinked developer sandbox

There are two web3 libraries that provide base infrastructure required for droplinked's operation on any given chain:

* [**NFT Fractionalizer**](https://fractionalizer.droplinked.com/)
* **DIMST registry by chain of choice** (Decentralized Inventory Management and Sales Tracking) - [Stacks](https://gitlab.com/flatlay/droplinked-contract), [Casper](https://github.com/FLATLAY/droplinked\_casper), [NEAR](https://github.com/FLATLAY/Droplinked-NEAR-Contract/blob/main/README.md), [SKALE](https://github.com/FLATLAY/droplinked\_skale), [XRPL](https://github.com/FLATLAY/droplinked-ripple/blob/main/README.md) (EVM side-chain), Hedera, Base, Polygon, Solana (coming soon)
* [**Droplinked events dapp**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/NnSJON87lgNKuwDs2pEl/introduction/droplinked-events) (Proof of Attendance for on-chain ticket and event management - POAP)

To interact with the droplinked protocol, droplinked provides three key tools:

* **OAuth**
  * Use crypto wallet credentials to authenticate and interact with the droplinked protocol
* **DIMST Console**
  * CLI and UI for simple execution of product registration, inventory management, sales tracking, and batch operations
* **Embeddable Cards**
  * Headless embeddable units for inventory display that allows producers and publishers to quickly and easily embed droplinked registered inventory onto their own pages,  properties and sites with an iFrame component that operates completely decentralized or with minimal centralized functionalities for web2 and web3 enablement
* **Metamask Snap**
  * A direct integration with the native MetaMask userbase to interact with the protocol to create decentralized shopfronts, product drops and checkout

### Timeline

Deployment across these networks allows for commerce settlement in the native token for each respective network and will serve as the foundation for cross-chain interoperability bridges to droplinkeds protocol.

droplinked testnet development is underway. droplinked testnet will tie together the base infrastructure that allows for a holistic cross-chain protocol, complete with token contracts, droplinked treasury and staking functionality.&#x20;
